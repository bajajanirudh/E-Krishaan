# E-Krishaan
This project is implemented through a website coded in DJango, HTML and CSS, it's recommended to download and launch this code through desktop.
## Objectives
1. Upliftment of farmers by providing them knowledge regarding latest MSP and hence contributing in increasing their income.
2. Connecting them digitally to various Krishi-mandis and other traders and increase their reach.
## Motivation
Many times, farmers don't have required information about Minimum Support Price (MSP) and some farmers even don't know about the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMCs) available near them. A simple Google search may not allow you to find all this information. Then they sell their grains at a lower price and have lower margins. Therefore, we developed a website which contains all the necessary information about MSPs, APMCs and nearby buyers, so that farmers have the information about the actual prices which can be expected from their grains.
## What we have built
We have developed a website that can cater to the needs of farmers looking for information about the actual value of their grains and from where they can get it. The website allows farmers to search for MSPs of their grain and also to search for the buyers from whom they can get a better price. Farmers can also contact us through the website if they face any difficulties.
